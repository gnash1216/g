            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p><strong><em>Steaks are always a favorite food whether you are into fine dining or into down to earth fire-grilled picnic or campfire mood. Yet preparing and cooking steak isn’t just as simple as being charred, well-done or rare. In fact, true to its finest, it is sometimes prepared and eaten raw. Whether your preference is butter-soft fillet steak, flavor-packed sirloin or thriftier cut like bavette, rump, or onglet (hanger), quick-cooking and constant attention should be paid when cooking your beef. With only a few minutes leeway between rare and well-done, timing is key. Let’s look at the conundrums of preparing and cooking steak.&nbsp;</em></strong><br></p><p><strong><em>
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>THE CUT
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>The cut of steak you use is down to personal preference and budget. Different cuts will deliver different levels of tenderness and flavor.
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Sirloin: Considered to be a prime steak, like fillet, but with more flavor. Best served medium-rare.
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>T-bone: To make sure everything cooks evenly, it is best to finish in the oven. Great for sharing.
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Bavette and flank steak: Cheap cut that’s best served no more than medium and is great for barbecuing.
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Fillet: Prized as the most tender cut, it’s also the most expensive. It has little fat and is best served as rare as you like.
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Rib-eye and tomahawk: There are two cuts to note: rib-eye, boneless and usually serves one, and rib on the bone, also known as côte de boeuf.
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Flat-iron: This steak is cut from the shoulder blade and is great value and neatly shaped, but it needs to be cooked no more than medium or it will be tough.
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Onglet: Also called hanger steak, this rope-shaped piece of meat has lots of flavors but will be tough if cooked beyond rare.
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Rump steak: The least expensive of prime steaks, it will be tough if cooked anything beyond medium.
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>THE STYLE
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>How well or rare you like them cooked can be practically determined by categorizing it like so:
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Blue: Should still be a dark color, almost purple, and just warm. It will feel spongy with no resistance.
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Rare: Dark red in color with some red juice flowing. It will feel soft and spongy with slight resistance. 
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Medium-rare: Pink in color with some juice. It will be a bit soft and spongy and slightly springy. 
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Medium: Pale pink in the middle with hardly any juice. It will feel firm and springy.
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Well-done: Only a trace of pink color but not dry. It will feel spongy and soft and slightly springy.
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>WAYS TO COOK
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Steak is kind of a statement food, carrying with it associations of power, taste, and money, and for good reason. But there is far more to steak than a stereotype and a price tag, and treating every steak the same would be a foolish disservice. So next time you feel the need to eat a steak, stop before you blindly throw it on the grill. Read on because there's more than one way to perfectly cook a steak.
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Grill
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>If someone is planning to cook a steak somewhere in the USA, chances are this is how it will be done. Grilling steak is quick, simple, and after a short period of learning, hard to mess up. All you need is a grill (gas or charcoal), some steaks, salt, pepper, and oil.
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Pan-fry
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Pan-frying a steak is not dissimilar to grilling, except it doesn't require you go outside. Just like the grill, you want to make sure your pan is hot. A cast-iron pan or a similar heavy-bottomed skillet works best because they hold more heat. And when you drop a steak into a hot one of those, the Maillard reaction has no excuse not to do its best work.
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Butter steak
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>The butter steak is a variation of the pan fry method, only with more butter and therefore more deliciousness.
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Reverse sear
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>A tried-and-true technique for cooking your favorite lump of a cow is to just throw it straight onto the hottest part of the grill. A common variation on this method for thicker steaks starts the same way, on a very hot grill, but quickly moves to an oven for a more gentle finish. Both methods work.
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>Steak tartare
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>There is one preparation method that is all too often overlooked, probably because at first glance it doesn't appear to require any preparation at all. But that's a mistake. Steak tartare is a popular dish in France and has a healthy following in the U.S. as well. However, since a lot of people struggle with the idea of a rare steak, a totally raw one is usually out of the question. Steak tartare is not only odd for the lack of heat involved in its preparation. It also stands out due to the fact that the steak is chopped up before serving. But if all the classy diners in France had to gnaw on a whole raw steak, the dish probably wouldn't have been quite so successful.
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>
</em></strong></p><p><strong><em>There could still be lots of ways you can cook a steak that will satisfy you to your exact liking. It all depends really on how you prefer to have your steak and perhaps how adventurous you’d like to be in trying them out.
